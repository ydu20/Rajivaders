# Rajivaders
A version of the space invaders game where the aliens are the bi-weekly 
psets and exams in CIS 160, and the spaceship is the student/TA/Rajiv himself. 

The goal of the student is to demolish all tasks (PSets, exams) before they 
reach him. Each task has a specific full score, and when it is hit, it gains 
a certain number of points (depending on the power of the player). When the 
number of points surpasses the full score, the task disappears. If the player 
doesnâ€™t manage to make all tasks disappear before they reach him, he loses.
